| 2 | Approximations/interpolation make sense | ✅ YES | Linear interpolation between years is reasonable |
| 3 | Curves defined by sufficient number of points | ✅ YES | Biennial data points appear sufficient |
| 4 | Building method of curve is clear | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Appears to be linear interpolation but not explicitly stated |
| 5 | Confidence intervals visualized | ❌ NO | No confidence intervals or error bars shown |
| 6 | Histogram steps are adequate | N/A | Not a histogram |
| 7 | Histograms visualize probabilities | N/A | Not a histogram |

### Graphical Objects

| # | Criterion | Pass? | Comment |
|---|-----------|-------|---------|

## Summary of Issues

### Critical Problems:
- **No Y-axis label**: Unclear what is being measured
- **No units specified**: Are these cars sold? Thousands? Millions?
- **Y-axis doesn't start at zero**: Creates visual distortion without explanation

### Minor Issues:
- No confidence intervals or error indicators
- Title could be more descriptive
- No accompanying text or context
- Interpolation method not specified
